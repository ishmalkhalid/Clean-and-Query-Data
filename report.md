* country: String
* year: Integer
* sex: String
* age: String
* suicides_no: Integer
* population: Integer

# Table Design 

THESE WERE MY FIELDS

country TEXT NOT NULL,
year INTEGER NOT NULL,
sex TEXT NOT NULL,
age TEXT NOT NULL,
suicides_no INTEGER,
population INTEGER,
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL

For my column 1 "country", I used the TEXT data type as all the values are written in plain string and represent each country. There is a value for country in each row therefore I have not allowed NULL values for this field.

For my column 2 "year", I used the INTEGER data type as all the values are written in plain integers and represent each year. There is a value for year in each row therefore I have not allowed NULL values for this field.

For my column 3 "sex", I used the TEXT data type as all the values are written in plain string and represent one of the two sexes "male" or "female". There is a value for sex in each row therefore I have not allowed NULL values for this field.

For my column 4 "age", I used the TEXT data type as all the values are written in a mix of integers and alphabets and represent age groups. There is a value for age in each row therefore I have not allowed NULL values for this field.

For my column 5 "suicides_no", I used the INTEGER data type as all the values are written in plain integers and represent the number of suicides. There is not a value for suicide_no in each row therefore I have allowed NULL values for this field.

For my column 6 "population", I used the INTEGER data type as all the values are written in plain integers and represent the overall population. There is not a value for population in each row therefore I have allowed NULL values for this field.

For my column 7 "id", I set it as the primary key for my dataset as I did not have a column which had unique values for each row. my "id" automatically increments with each row and it cannot be a NULL value as each row must have a primary key. It is unique to each row of the table.

# Import

While importing my file to the database I encountered an error pertinent to the file path. Initially I used an absolute file path to import data from my csv file but it gave me an error. Due to this reason, I put the process file in same directory as source file and ran from there using relative file path. This allowed me to import my data into my table and save the database. 

# Database Information

COMMAND (1):
	sqlite> .tables
```
-- OUTPUT
	suicidestats
```

COMMAND (2):
	sqlite> .schema
```
-- OUTPUT
	CREATE TABLE suicidestats (
	        country TEXT NOT NULL,
	        year INTEGER NOT NULL,
	        sex TEXT NOT NULL,
	        age TEXT NOT NULL,
	        suicides_no INTEGER,
	        population INTEGER,
	        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL
	        );
	        
	CREATE TABLE sqlite_sequence(name,seq);

# Query Results

```
-- 1. do some rudimentary data cleaning by modifying values in a column or columns (such as change '' to NULL, cast types, etc.) â€¦ instead of adding the results of the query or queries to report.md, write the motivation for modifying / cleaning your data in this way	
sqlite> UPDATE suicidestats


This query produces no output.

```

```
-- 2. the total number of rows in the database

COUNT (*)
---------
41520

```

```
-- 3. show the first 15 rows, but only display 3 columns (your choice)
age          sex     population
-----------  ------  ----------
15-24 years  female  289700
25-34 years  female  257200
35-54 years  female  278800
5-14 years   female  311000
55-74 years  female  144600
75+ years    female  35600
15-24 years  male    312900
25-34 years  male    274300
35-54 years  male    308000
5-14 years   male    338200
55-74 years  male    137500
75+ years    male    21800
15-24 years  female  295600
25-34 years  female  262400
35-54 years  female  284500

```

```
-- 4. do the same as above, but choose a column to sort on, and sort in descending order
age          sex     population
-----------  ------  ----------
35-54 years  female  43805214
35-54 years  female  43607902
35-54 years  female  43509335
35-54 years  female  43240905
35-54 years  male    43139910
35-54 years  male    43002471
35-54 years  female  42997878
35-54 years  male    42992076
35-54 years  female  42957716
35-54 years  male    42932194
35-54 years  female  42893858
35-54 years  female  42836835
35-54 years  male    42835394
35-54 years  male    42798501
35-54 years  female  42711237
```

```
--5. add a new column without a default value


This query produces no output.
```

```
--6. set the value of that new column


This query produces no output.
```

```
--7. show only the unique (non duplicates) of a column of your choice

age
-----------
15-24 years
25-34 years
35-54 years
5-14 years
55-74 years
75+ years
```

```
--8. group rows together by a column value (your choice) and use an aggregate function to calculate something about that group (count of all members of the group, the average of a column of the members of the group)
----- show the column that is used for grouping AND the result of the aggregate function (so, 2 columns minimum on output)
